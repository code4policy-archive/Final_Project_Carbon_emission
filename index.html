        <title>U.S. Carbon Emissions by State</title>

        <h1>U.S. Carbon Emissions: How Does Your State Compare?</h1>
        <h1>President Biden has pledged that the United States will reach net-zero emissions by 2050</h1>
            <p>But the United States is not a monolith, and its 50 states have different economies, energy mixes, politics, and, as a result, different emissions levels. To ensure that the U.S. achieves its net-zero goals, it is necessary to understand which states are the highest carbon emitters, which are the lowest carbon emitters, and the lessons that can be learned from each.</p>

            <p>The state with the highest carbon emissions per capita in 2018 was Wyoming, with 109.9 metric tons emitted per resident of the state. The states with the lowest emissions, meanwhile, were California and New York, at only 9 metric tons per resident. The median state emitted 16.3 metric tons per capita in 2018.</p> 
        <h1>All US States will experience warmer summers and winters from 2020-2039 compared to 1981-2010</h1>
            <p>During the winter, the highest impacts will be felt in Alaska, Northern New England,  the Great Lakes region, and the Dakotas. Higher temperatures my impact businesses whose livelihoods depend on severe winters, such as ski resorts, snow removal companies, and heating contractors. </p>

            <p>During the summer, one of the most notable impact will be to the potato growing region of the United States. In Idaho, temperatures are expected to increase by 2.6 degrees. One iconic potato variety commonly used for French Fries, the Russet Burbank is extremely sensitive to temperature changes. Even small increases in environmental temperature can cause a discloring of fries made from the potatoes.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, an increase in average temperatures would overall benefit energy use across most states. In future decades, warmer winters will decrease the need for heating, reducing energy consumption. Significant decrease in energy costs are evident in areas with notoriously harsh winters, such as Alaska, Maine, Colorado, and Ohio.</p>
