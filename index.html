        <h1>U.S. Carbon Emissions: How Does Your State Compare?</h1>
        <h1>President Biden has pledged that the United States will reach net-zero emissions by 2050</h1>
            <p>But the United States is not a monolith, and its 50 states have different economies, energy mixes, politics, and, as a result, different emissions levels. To ensure that the U.S. achieves its net-zero goals, it is necessary to understand which states are the highest carbon emitters, which are the lowest carbon emitters, and the lessons that can be learned from each.</p>
