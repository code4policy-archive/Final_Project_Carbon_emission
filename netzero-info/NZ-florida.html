	<p>Since 2010, Florida has received $22.8 million from the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and $17.7 million from the State Energy Program (SEP), resulting in the following benefits:</p>

	<h2>Florida's State Energy Program at Work</h2>
		<h3>Florida Wastewater Treatment Plant Energy Program</h3>
		<p>The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Office of Energy (FDACS OOE) is using $2 million SEP funds to impact energy projects at publicly-owned wastewater treatment plants. The performance of 15 competitively awarded participants throughout the state is measured for each project according to net annual energy saved at the facility, energy saved per dollar funded, and the amount of energy used to process one million gallons of wastewater. This project represents a tremendous opportunity for Florida wastewater treatment plants to reduce energy use and reduce greenhouse gases by installing energy-efficient equipment and implementing conservation strategies.</p>

		<h3>Florida Counties Low-Income Residential Energy Efficient Grant Program</h3>
		<p>FDACS OOE is using $1 million from SEP to fund the Florida Counties Low-Income Residential Energy Efficient Grant Program. Recognizing that housing, health, and energy efficiency are closely intertwined, the program seeks to reduce the burden of residential high energy cost expenditures through the improvement of ventilation, insulation, and inefficient equipment. This grant program is providing funding in Broward, Miami-Dade, Orange, and Sarasota Counties to assist low-income single-family and multifamily households with energy efficiency measures. The project's target date for completion was Nov. 30, 2021, and energy savings are being tracked for at least one year prior to the upgrade and one year following completion of the project. </p>

		<h3>Florida EV Roadmap</h3>
		<p>Beginning in 2019, the FDACS OOE began working on the Electric Vehicle (EV) Roadmap for the state of Florida. FDACS OOE utilized $135,000 in SEP funds to develop the roadmap. FDACS OOE released the Florida EV Roadmap on Dec. 31, 2020, based on stakeholder involvement and five interim and supplemental reports.

		The EV Roadmap identifies EV charging infrastructure impacts on the electric grid, solutions for any negative impacts, locations that lack EV charging infrastructure, best practices for siting EV charging stations, and technical or regulatory barriers to the expansion of EV charging infrastructure.

		Through this project, the FDACS OOE sought to elevate the visibility of EV infrastructure within the state and enhance discussion on how to prepare for increased EV use. This was achieved through stakeholder and end-user engagement. Gathering information from end users is crucial to understanding the performance of the existing infrastructure, and the planning needed for future infrastructure.
