	<h2>Texas's State Energy Program at Work</h2>
		<h3>Emerging Clean Energy Technologies Program</h3>
		<p>Texas' Emerging Clean Energy Technologies Program assists in developing commercially viable clean energy technologies at designated Clean Energy Incubators (CEIs). CEIs have played a vital role in helping clean energy startups adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic. From facilitating the transition to remote operations to navigating local, state, and federal relief funds opportunities, CEIs provided mentoring support necessary for startups to continue operations.</p>

		<p>Between July 2020â€“June 2021, incubated companies from the University of Texas at Austin Clean Energy Incubator and the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station Clean Energy Incubator raised more than $19.2 million. Their activities resulted in a total economic impact of more than $15.6 million to the State of Texas.</p>
		

		<h3>LoanSTAR Program</h3>
		<p>The Texas Saving Taxes and Resources (LoanSTAR) Program is administered by the Texas State Energy Conservation Office and funded in part by formula funds from the State Energy Program. This program issues loans targeted for public buildings, including state agencies, school districts, higher education, local governments, and hospitals. As of August 2021, LoanSTAR has funded approximately 328 loans totaling approximately $553 million. The LoanSTAR Program has achieved total cumulative program energy savings of over $725 million, which results in direct savings to Texas taxpayers.</p>
