	<p>Since 2010, California has received $67 million from the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and $33.8 million from the State Energy Program (SEP), resulting in the following benefits:</p>

	<h2>California's State Energy Program at Work</h2>
		<h3>Appliance Efficiency Program</h3>
		<p>California uses SEP funds to support its Appliance Efficiency Program. Recent appliance efficiency regulations that were adopted or became effective in 2019 and 2020:</p>
		<ol></ol>
			<li>General Service Lamps (Adopted Nov. 13, 2019; Effective Jan. 1, 2020)</li>
			<li>Spray Sprinkler Bodies (Effective Oct. 1, 2020)</li>
			<li>Dedicated-Purpose Pool Pumps and Dedicated-Purpose Pool Pump Motors (Adopted April 8, 2019; Effective July 19, 2021)</li>
		<p>The general service lamps regulations are estimated to save between 4,000 to 13,600 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year, and between $740 million to $2.5 billion annually in utility bill savings to consumers. The water efficiency of spray sprinkler bodies will save approximately 150 billion gallons of water per year, avoid consumption of 540 GWh of electricity and provide consumers nearly $1 billion in utility bill savings. Efficiency standards for dedicated-purpose pool pump motors will save consumers $83 million through reduced electricity consumption, and 450 GWh annually upon full stock turnover.</p>

		<h3>Building Energy Efficiency Program</h3>
		<p>California uses SEP funds to support its Building Energy Efficiency Program. On Aug. 11, 2021, the California Energy Commission (CEC) adopted the 2022 Building Energy Efficiency Standards (Energy Code) for newly constructed and renovated buildings that will produce benefits to support the state's public health, climate and clean energy goals. The 2022 update is expected to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2023.</p>
