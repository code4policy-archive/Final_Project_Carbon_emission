        <p><b>Contact your elected officials—state, local, and national.</b> Addressing climate change at the scale that is needed will require political solutions at all levels of government, and, as a constituent, elected officials are obliged to respond to your concerns. To find contact information for your elected officials, see <a href="https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials">here</a>.</p><br>
        <p><i>Not sure what to ask your elected officials to do? </i> Here are some policies you can push for: 
            <ul> <li> At the local level, elected officials can reduce emissions through <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Environment/ClimateChange/2013_CAP_20130612.pdf">such actions as investments in public transit, walking, and cycling infrastructure</a>; electrifying public transit; <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/we-cant-beat-the-climate-crisis-without-rethinking-land-use">prioritizing dense housing development</a> in walkable and public-transit friendly areas, and moving toward 100% clean energy grids for electricity. </li> <li> At the state level, policies that states can implement include carbon pricing, clean energy electricity policies, emissions standards for vehicles, restoring forests, and improving building codes for energy efficiency. (For more on state-level actions, see <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/state-climate-policy">here</a>.) </li> <li> And, at the national level, the government has the most sweeping authority of all, with the ability to set a national clean energy standard, invest in decarbonization at a scale unmatchable by the states, and <a href="https://www.c2es.org/document/climate-policy-priorities-for-the-new-administration-and-congress">much more</a>.</p><br> </li></ul>

        <p><b>Vote for pro-climate candidates.</b> By voting only for candidates who take the threat of climate change seriously, you can help to elect officials who will work to implement policies that are needed. To find candidates' views on climate change, you can check their campaign website, ask them directly at town halls and other forums, and check Members of Congress' environmental scorecard rankings <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/">here</a>.</p><br>

        <p><b>Volunteer with a local environmental group.</b> National environmental nonprofits like the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org">Sierra Club</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us">The Nature Conservancy</a> have local chapters across the United States. Meanwhile, innumerable state and local nonprofits work on environmental issues and are looking for volunteers; to find them, google "climate change nonprofit [my area]" or search <a href="https://greatnonprofits.org/categories/view/climate-change">here</a>.</p><br>

        <p><b>Talk to your neighbors, friends, and family about climate change.</b> Because climate change is, in the United States, a polarized issue, it is important to leverage the fact that people trust people they know more than they do scientists or other experts. By talking to climate skeptics about the importance of addressing climate change, you can go beyond partisan politics and build awareness in your community. For more on how to hold climate change conversations, see <a href="https://davidsuzuki.org/what-you-can-do/how-and-why-to-have-climate-change-conversations/">here</a>.</p><br>

        <p><b>Build climate sustainability into your daily life.</b> The idea of addressing climate change through personal choices is a controversial one, and it is true that global problems cannot be fixed by individuals. However, building sustainable practices into your life in whatever ways are possible—whether composting, relying more on public transit, eating less meat, or reducing the number of flights you take—can help to keep the climate in view as a key, mundane part of your life. (For more on how to think about individual actions in the climate change fight, see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/opinion/climate-change-environment.html">here</a>.</p><br>
