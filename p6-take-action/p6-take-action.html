	<h1>Take Action</h1>
<body>
	<h2>Reducing carbon emissions will require action from all of us. Here are some things you can do.</h2><br>
	<p><b>Contact your elected officialsâ€”state, local, and national.</b> Addressing climate change at the scale that is needed will require political solutions at all levels of government, and, as a constituent, elected officials are obliged to respond to your concerns. To find contact information for your elected officials, see <a href="https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials">here</a>.</p><br>
	<p>Not sure what to ask your elected officials to do? Here are some policies you can push for: At the local level, elected officials can reduce emissions through <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Environment/ClimateChange/2013_CAP_20130612.pdf">such actions as investments in public transit, walking, and cycling infrastructure</a>; electrifying public transit; <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/we-cant-beat-the-climate-crisis-without-rethinking-land-use">prioritizing dense housing development</a> in walkable and public-transit friendly areas, and moving toward 100% clean energy grids for electricity. At the state level, policies that states can implement include carbon pricing, clean energy electricity policies, emissions standards for vehicles, restoring forests, and improving building codes for energy efficiency. (For more on state-level actions, see <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/state-climate-policy">here</a>.) And, at the national level, the government has the most sweeping authority of all, with the ability to set a national clean energy standard, invest in decarbonization at a scale unmatchable by the states, and <a href="https://www.c2es.org/document/climate-policy-priorities-for-the-new-administration-and-congress">much more</a>.</p><br>
	<p><b>Volunteer with a local environmental group.</b> National environmental nonprofits like the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org">Sierra Club</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us">The Nature Conservancy</a> have local chapters across the United States. Meanwhile, innumerable state and local nonprofits work on environmental issues and are looking for volunteers; to find them, google "climate change nonprofit [my area]" or search <a href="https://greatnonprofits.org/categories/view/climate-change">here</a>.</p><br>
