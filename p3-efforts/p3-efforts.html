        <h1>The USA is Moving to Net-Zero by 2050</h1>
            <p>One of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) primary forums for helping state and local governments implement cost-effective and productive energy systems for American homes, communities, businesses, and industries is the Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs Office (WIP). WIP is part of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and supports a national energy strategy to create greater energy affordability, security, and resiliency. WIP's mission is to enable strategic investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies with innovative practices across the United States by a wide range of stakeholders, in partnership with state and local organizations and community-based non-profits. WIP is made up of two programs focused on state and local governments, Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and State Energy Program (SEP).</p>

            <p>WAP and SEP provide funding and technical assistance to states, territories, the District of Columbia, and Native American tribes to enhance energy security, advance state-led energy initiatives, maximize the benefits of decreasing energy waste, and reduce energy costs for low-income households. Each state is the decision maker and administrator for SEP and WAP program activities tailored to their unique resources, delivery and production capacity, and energy goals.</p>

            <p>Three highest carbon emissions states' efforts to achieve Net-zero under this program are provided below</p>
