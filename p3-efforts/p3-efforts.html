            <h1>The USA is Moving to Net-Zero by 2050</h1>
            <p>One of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) primary forums for helping state and local governments implement cost-effective and productive energy systems for American homes, communities, businesses, and industries is the <b>Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs Office (WIP)</b>. WIP is part of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and supports a national energy strategy to create greater energy affordability, security, and resiliency. WIP is made up of two programs focused on state and local governments, <b>Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and State Energy Program (SEP)</b>.</p>

            <p>WAP and SEP provide funding and technical assistance to states, territories, the District of Columbia, and Native American tribes to enhance energy security, advance state-led energy initiatives, maximize the benefits of decreasing energy waste, and reduce energy costs for low-income households. Each state is the decision maker and administrator for SEP and WAP program activities tailored to their unique resources, delivery and production capacity, and energy goals.</p>

            <h3>Efforts to achieve Net-Zero Emissions under these programs by three highest carbon emitting states are highlighted below</h3>

            <h1>California</h2>
            <p>Since 2010, California has received $67 million from the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and $33.8 million from the State Energy Program (SEP)</p>

            <h1>California's State Energy Program at Work</h2>
            <h3>Appliance Efficiency Program</h3>
            <p>California uses SEP funds to support its Appliance Efficiency Program. Recent appliance efficiency regulations that were adopted or became effective in 2019 and 2020</p>
            <h3>Building Energy Efficiency Program</h3>
            <p>California uses SEP funds to support its Building Energy Efficiency Program. On Aug. 11, 2021, the California Energy Commission (CEC) adopted the 2022 Building Energy Efficiency Standards (Energy Code) for newly constructed and renovated buildings that will produce benefits to support the state's public health, climate and clean energy goals. The 2022 update is expected to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2023.</p>

            <h1>Texas</h2>
            <p>Since 2010, Texas has received $62.1 million from the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and $30.9 million from the State Energy Program (SEP)</p>

            <h1>Texas's State Energy Program at Work</h2>
            <h3>Emerging Clean Energy Technologies Program</h3>
            <p>Texas' Emerging Clean Energy Technologies Program assists in developing commercially viable clean energy technologies at designated Clean Energy Incubators (CEIs). CEIs have played a vital role in helping clean energy startups adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic. From facilitating the transition to remote operations to navigating local, state, and federal relief funds opportunities, CEIs provided mentoring support necessary for startups to continue operations.</p>

            <h3>LoanSTAR Program</h3>
            <p>The Texas Saving Taxes and Resources (LoanSTAR) Program is administered by the Texas State Energy Conservation Office and funded in part by formula funds from the State Energy Program. This program issues loans targeted for public buildings, including state agencies, school districts, higher education, local governments, and hospitals. As of August 2021, LoanSTAR has funded approximately 328 loans totaling approximately $553 million. The LoanSTAR Program has achieved total cumulative program energy savings of over $725 million, which results in direct savings to Texas taxpayers.</p>

            <h1>Florida</h2>
            <p>Since 2010, Florida has received $22.8 million from the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and $17.7 million from the State Energy Program (SEP)</p>

            <h1>Florida's State Energy Program at Work</h2>
            <h3>Florida Wastewater Treatment Plant Energy Program</h3>
            <p>The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Office of Energy (FDACS OOE) is using $2 million SEP funds to impact energy projects at publicly-owned wastewater treatment plants. The performance of 15 competitively awarded participants throughout the state is measured for each project according to net annual energy saved at the facility, energy saved per dollar funded, and the amount of energy used to process one million gallons of wastewater. This project represents a tremendous opportunity for Florida wastewater treatment plants to reduce energy use and reduce greenhouse gases by installing energy-efficient equipment and implementing conservation strategies.</p>
            
            <h3>Florida EV Roadmap</h3>
            <p>Beginning in 2019, the FDACS OOE began working on the Electric Vehicle (EV) Roadmap for the state of Florida. FDACS OOE utilized $135,000 in SEP funds to develop the roadmap. FDACS OOE released the Florida EV Roadmap on Dec. 31, 2020, based on stakeholder involvement and five interim and supplemental reports. The EV Roadmap identifies EV charging infrastructure impacts on the electric grid, solutions for any negative impacts, locations that lack EV charging infrastructure, best practices for siting EV charging stations, and technical or regulatory barriers to the expansion of EV charging infrastructure.</p>
