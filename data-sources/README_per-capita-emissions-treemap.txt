To create the D3 treemap visualizing per capita emissions in 2018, I did the following;

1. Downloaded the Excel spreadsheet of per capita emissions data from Table 5 here: https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/

2. Filtered the spreadsheet to only show data from 2018.

3. Converted the xls to a csv by changing the ending of the file name.

4. Adapted the csv to have the same format as the D3 chart I was adapting, as seen here: https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/treemap_basic.html

Plugged that csv into the dataset, modified the dimensions and color, and otherwise adapted the code.
