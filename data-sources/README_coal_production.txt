Coal Production D3 Map Production Process 

Step 1: Download the Data Source from the https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/xls/stb0702.xls

Step 2: I only choose the data from 1990 to 2020, filtered data to ensure that only annual coal production data was going to be included. Save file into .CSV

Step 3: I choose this D3 map right here https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/area_basic.html

Step 4: I copy pasted the HTML script for the D3 map into Sublime Text. I splited the script for HTML and JavaScript into two separate files. I linked the csv file to the javascript file. 

Step 5: I edited the JavaScript file to ensure the chart had labels on the x and y axis. I ensured that the date format in the JavaScript worked with the format already used by the chart. 

Step 6: Linked the Javascript file to HTML, making sure that the chart will appear.
