        <h1>U.S. Carbon Emissions: How Does Your State Compare?</h1>
        <h1>President Biden has pledged that the United States will reach net-zero emissions by 2050</h1>
            <p>But the United States is not a monolith, and its 50 states have different economies, energy mixes, politics, and, as a result, different emissions levels. To ensure that the U.S. achieves its net-zero goals, it is necessary to understand which states are the highest carbon emitters, which are the lowest carbon emitters, and the lessons that can be learned from each.</p>

            <p>The state with the highest carbon emissions per capita in 2018 was Wyoming, with 109.9 metric tons emitted per resident of the state. The states with the lowest emissions, meanwhile, were California and New York, at only 9 metric tons per resident. The median state emitted 16.3 metric tons per capita in 2018.</p> 

            <p> However, the story is quite different when we look at absolute carbon emissions by state. Wyoming is below the median in carbon emissions, whereas states like California, Texas and Florida have the highest carbon emissions. </p>
