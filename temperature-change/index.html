        <h1><b>Beware of Warmer Summer and Winters Ahead!</b></h1>
     
        <h1>All US States will experience warmer summers and winters from 2020-2039 compared to 1981-2010</h1>

            <p>During the winter, the highest impacts will be felt in Alaska, Northern New England,  the Great Lakes region, and the Dakotas. Higher temperatures my impact businesses whose livelihoods depend on severe winters, such as ski resorts, snow removal companies, and heating contractors. </p>

            <p>During the summer, one of the most notable impact will be to the potato growing region of the United States. In Idaho, temperatures are expected to increase by 2.6 degrees. One iconic potato variety commonly used for French Fries, the Russet Burbank is extremely sensitive to temperature changes. Even small increases in environmental temperature can cause a discloring of fries made from the potatoes.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, an increase in average temperatures would overall benefit energy use across most states. In future decades, warmer winters will decrease the need for heating, reducing energy consumption. Significant decrease in energy costs are evident in areas with notoriously harsh winters, such as Alaska, Maine, Colorado, and Ohio.</p>
